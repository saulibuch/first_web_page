# My playground
This is repository for personal use with single purpose - to learn Python.

Currently I'm studying from book by Zed Shaw (https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book ). Even though Zed warned from using Python 3, I'm doing it, as I want to learn the language probably (and hopefully) used in the future.
